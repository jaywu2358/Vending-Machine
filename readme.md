This is the first project that I did in bootcamp. It takes in a text menu file, read it, and populate the vending machine with stcok and price information. It was really challenge to deal with float, int in Java but it was all worth it
when I finished building the application and saw it running perfectly as intended. This is the moment that I knew software development is "my" thing!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## KEY FEATURES

1. Generate a menu from a text-based file. Insert each item into a dedicated slot and add stock and price information for each item.

2. Before you can purchase, you need to feed money first! We are not selling for free.

</br>

3. Select an item you want by entering the slot number. NOTE: I added the "not sufficient fund" try catch to make sure the user has enough money. You are also not allowed to purchase out-of-stock items or slots not in the machine!
   When you purchase a corresponding type of item, you will receive a special message. In this showcase, since the buyer purchased a1(potato crips), the special message is "Crunch Crunch, Yum!"
